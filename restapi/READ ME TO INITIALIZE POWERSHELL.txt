If your PowerShell script refuses to connect to the remote server, try these two tips:

Run PowerShell as Administrator. Enter "Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned". Otherwise, 
PowerShell won't connect to cloud servers. This seems to be a one-time fix. 

Open the PowerShell window where you will be working. Before running any scripts, enter: 

[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls11 -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12

Otherwise, PowerShell runs into TLS version issues and fails to connect. 

I have added this setting to all of the scripts as boilerplate, even though it really needs 
to be executed only once per session. 

There is an article here (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49476326/displaying-unicode-in-powershell)
about getting PowerShell to display unicode characters properly.
