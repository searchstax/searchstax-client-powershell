CAN'T CONNECT:

If your PowerShell script refuses to connect to the remote server, try these two tips:

Run PowerShell as Administrator. Enter "Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned". Otherwise, 
PowerShell won't connect to cloud servers.  

Open the PowerShell window where you will be working. Before running any scripts, enter: 

[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls11 -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12

Otherwise, PowerShell runs into TLS version issues and fails to connect. 

I have added this setting to all of the scripts as boilerplate, even though it really needs 
to be executed only once per session. 

DISPLAY OF UNICODE CHARACTERS

Powershell displays this:
       "operator": ">",

Like this:
       "operator":  "\u003e",

There is an article here (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49476326/displaying-unicode-in-powershell)
about getting PowerShell to display unicode characters properly. 

KNOWN BUG:

There is a PowerShell display bug evident when you use accountdeploymentalertsread.ps1.  The JSON list of
alert email addresses looks like this in Linux:

      "email": [
        "bruce@searchstax.com",
        "user@searchstax.com",
        "party@searchstax.com"
      ]

but looks like this in PowerShell:

      "email":  "bruce@searchstax.com user@searchstax.com party@searchstax.com"
