CAN'T CONNECT:

If your PowerShell script refuses to connect to the remote server, try these two tips:

Run PowerShell as Administrator. Enter "Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned". Otherwise, 
PowerShell won't connect to cloud servers.  

Open the PowerShell window where you will be working. Before running any scripts, enter: 

[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls11 -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12

Otherwise, PowerShell runs into TLS version issues and fails to connect. 

I have added the latter setting to all of the scripts as boilerplate, even though it really needs 
to be executed only once per session. 

DISPLAY OF UNICODE CHARACTERS

Powershell displays this:
       "operator": ">",

Like this:
       "operator":  "\u003e",

There is an article here (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49476326/displaying-unicode-in-powershell)
about getting PowerShell to display unicode characters properly. 

KNOWN BUGS:

There is a PowerShell display bug evident when you display JSON structures that have embedded 
lists.  A JSON list of alert email addresses looks like this in Linux:

      "email": [
        "bruce@searchstax.com",
        "user@searchstax.com",
        "party@searchstax.com"
      ]

but looks like this in PowerShell (after passing through the ConvertTo-Json filter):

      "email":  "bruce@searchstax.com user@searchstax.com party@searchstax.com"

Similarly, a list of deployment specifications looks like this in Linux:

      "specifications": {
        "disk_space": "34359738368",
        "jvm_heap_memory": "2147483648",
        "physical_memory": "4294967296"
      }

but looks like this in PowerShell (after passing through the ConvertTo-Json filter):

      "specifications":  "@{disk_space=34359738368; jvm_heap_memory=2147483648; physical_memory=429496296}"
