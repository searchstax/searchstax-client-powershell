If your PowerShell script refuses to connect to the remote server, try these two tips:

Run PowerShell as Administrator. Enter "Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned". Otherwise, PowerShell 
won't connect to cloud servers. This seems to be a one-time fix. 

Open the PowerShell window where you will be working. Before running any scripts, enter "[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls11 -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12". Otherwise, PowerShell
runs into TLS version issues and fails to connect. 

I have added this setting to all of the 
scripts as boilerplate, even though it really needs to be executed only once per session.
